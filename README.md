# Personal-Site
**Neil Kyne**
This repository contains a personal site I made very shortly after graduating college. I made it with simplicity in mind. It is a basic static web page with no routing involved. I wanted it to display projects and highlight some of my skills in web development. It also contains links to external medias such as LinkedIn as well as hosts my CV. 

# Technologies Used
The site is made purely using React as well as some basic dependencies such as *React-Materialize* and *React-Icons*. It is hosted on Netlify!

## How To Run
